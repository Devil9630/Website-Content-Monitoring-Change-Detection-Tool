## 🌟 Overview
A powerful and lightweight tool designed to monitor website content changes in real-time. This tool continuously scans web pages and alerts administrators whenever any modification, deletion, or unauthorized change is detected.

## 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ **Real-time Monitoring**: Detects any unauthorized or accidental content changes.
- 📩 **Instant Alerts**: Sends email notifications specifying the modified section.
- 🌍 **Multi-Page Support**: Monitor multiple web pages simultaneously.
- 🛠️ **Website Security**: Helps in identifying defacements and unauthorized modifications.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **BeautifulSoup** 🏛️ (for HTML parsing)
- **Requests** 🌐 (for fetching web page content)
- **Hashing Algorithms** 🔑 (for content integrity checks)
- **SMTP** 📧 (for email alerts)

## 🎯 How It Works
1. The tool fetches the webpage content at predefined intervals.
2. Generates a hash of the page content and compares it with the previously stored hash.
3. If any changes are detected, an alert is triggered via email.
